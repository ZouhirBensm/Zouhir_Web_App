# Zouhir_Web_App

This is my web portfolio website. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end. I used SQL and PHP for the back-end. This project has nearly 500 lines of HTML code, and imports 5 style sheets and 3 JavaScripts scripts. The form at the end uses PHP to retrieve the input and to query the database. I embeded SQL commands within my PHP code to save your identify, e-mail and messages within my database. My PHP script also outputs a HTML thank you note, to notify the sender that his message has been sent. I hosted my website on a paying hosting platform with a bought domain name.
